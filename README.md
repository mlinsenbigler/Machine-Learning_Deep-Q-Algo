**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

The work performed on this project focused on creating a Q-training algorithm to implement deep Q-learning. I was provided the code for the Environment, the Experience for Replay, the Neural Network Model and the Main Game Loop. I created the algorithm to enable the intelligent agent find the best possible navigation sequence that resulted in finding the goal cell while maximizing the reward.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists leverage the power of algorithms and computer processing in order to solve problems. This matters because it can result in faster and more efficient ways of doing work and solving problems. It can also result in new ways of doing things because machines can present new ways of performing tasks that humans haven't thought of before.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

As acomputer scientist I approach a problem by breaking it down into sections. First, trying to get an overall approach to how the problem can be solved. Then laying out the components that will be needed to reach that goal. Finally, diving into the code and iterating through each module until the program is functional and complete.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization include keeping information private and secure and providing code that will function accoring to their requests. Coding a program than ensures security is extremely important. Also, keeping the functionality of a company's program confidential is an important responsibility of any computer scientist.
